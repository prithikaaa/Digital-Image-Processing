# Digital Image Processing

## Overview
This repository contains various digital image processing techniques implemented using Python. The primary libraries used include:

- **OpenCV**: For image processing and manipulation
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing images and processing results

## Features
The repository covers a range of image processing operations, including:

### 1. Basic Image Operations
- Reading and displaying images
- Converting images to grayscale
- Resizing and cropping
- Image rotation and flipping

### 2. Image Enhancement
- Histogram equalization
- Contrast and brightness adjustment
- Smoothing and blurring
- Sharpening filters

### 3. Edge Detection and Segmentation
- Canny edge detection
- Sobel, Prewitt, and Laplacian operators
- Image thresholding (Global, Adaptive, Otsu's method)
- Watershed segmentation

### 4. Morphological Operations
- Erosion and dilation
- Opening and closing
- Morphological gradient

### 5. Noise Removal
- Gaussian and median filtering
- Bilateral filtering

### 6. Image Transformation
- Affine and perspective transformations
- Fourier Transform (DFT, FFT)

### 7. Object Detection and Contour Analysis
- Contour detection and approximation
- Connected components analysis
